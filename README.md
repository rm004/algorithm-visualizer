# algorithm-visualizer

Welcome! This is my attempt to make an algorithm visualizer in pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am doing this because I never really learned how to work with the DOM and am learning this way. After the initial front end is working I have plans to add a backend with an express server and PostgreSQL database. This will allow for users to have profiles and save their configurations for viewing and editing later. I also hope this will give CS students in a Data Structures or Algorithms course a good visualization to solidify their understanding of the algorithms. Enjoy!
